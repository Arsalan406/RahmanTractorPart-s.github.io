    <p>
        A tractor is an engineering vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort (or torque) at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery such as that used in agriculture, mining or construction. Most commonly, the term is used to describe a farm vehicle that provides the power and traction to mechanize agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) tillage, but nowadays a great variety of tasks. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanised.

    <h3><a> Swaraj tractor</a></h3>

Formerly known as Punjab Tractors Limited, the company was taken over by Mahindra Group in 2007 and subsequently in 2009, the name was changed to swaraj division.[2] Punjab Tractors was the first Indian company to indigenously manufacture agricultural tractors in India, aptly named as Swaraj - giving a new dimension to the concept of self-reliance put forth by MK Gandhi. The seeds of this organization were sown in Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CMERI), Durgapur (West Bengal) in 1960s in the form of a design project, which later took the form of an organization in Mohali (Punjab), near Chandigarh.

<h3> Eicher </h3>
<p>
    The first Eicher tractor was made by Joseph and Albert Eicher in the 1930s, in the village of Forstern, near Munich, in Bavaria, Germany. It was the beginning of considerable development of Eicher's Forstern and Dingolfing factories. These pioneers made several tests and carried out a patient work of clarification. The first evolution was marked by the construction of an automatic mower and a three-wheeled tractor. In 1936, Eicher built the first diesel tractor with a 14.7 kW (20 hp) Deutz - diesel engine . The engine was welded to the frame and the rear axle was flanged. The gearbox was attached to the engine and passed the power via a propeller shaft to the rear axle. The mowing drive went from there via an open chain drive. One year later, in 1937, Eicher was represented for the first time at the DLG exhibition in Munich. The block-construction of the Eicher tractors with engines of Deutz and transmission of Prometheus prevailed in the following years. More and more tractors were sold, even tractors could be exported to Austria.

    Eicher brothers Joseph and Albert Eicher were born and grew up in an agricultural part of Germany. Their personal taste for agriculture favored the development of ideas which led to the manufacturing of machines and modern devices.
